#  What is the Premier League?

The Premier League, also referred to as the English Premier League (EPL), is England’s top-level professional men’s football league. It is made up of 20 teams, and operates a system of promotion and relegation with the Football League. The Premier League was founded in 1992, and is currently operated by the English Football Association (FA).

Since its creation, the Premier League has been one of the most popular football leagues in the world. It is broadcast in 212 territories to 643 million homes and viewers, and generates £2.2 billion (US$3.3 billion) in annual revenue. In terms of viewers, it is the most-watched live sports league in the world, with an average attendance of 36,445 people per game during the 2014-15 season.

The league is contested by 20 teams each year, with three promoted from the Football League Championship and three relegated from the Premier League. The teams are divided into two divisions: the Premier League and the Football League. The winners of each division are crowned champions, and qualify for European competition.

The current Premier League champions are Leicester City, who won their first top-flight title in 2015-16.

#  Who are the teams in it? 

The UEFA Champions League is an annual association football cup competition organized by UEFA since 1955 for the top football clubs in Europe. The final of the competition is the most watched annual sporting event worldwide.

There are several teams in it. But, the most popular and well-known ones are Real Madrid, Barcelona, Bayern Munich, and Juventus. These are usually the teams that make it to the later stages of the cup and sometimes even win it. However, there have been a few upsets in previous years with teams like Monaco and Porto winning the cup.

This year’s cup is shaping up to be another exciting one with all these teams in it. In particular, Barcelona and Juventus are looking like they might be a strong force to be reckoned with. They both have some of the best players in the world on their rosters, including Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo. So far, they have both had some successes in their respective leagues and look like they will do well in this year’s Champions League as well. 

Real Madrid is also always a strong contender for the cup. They have won it more times than any other team and always have some of the best players on their roster. This year, they brought in new players like Eden Hazard from Chelsea and Luka Modric from Tottenham Hotspur. With these new additions, they are looking good to make a deep run in this year’s tournament. 

As for Bayern Munich, they have always been a very strong team but have not had as much success recently in the Champions League as they used to. However, with new manager Niko Kovac at the helm, they are looking like they might finally make another run for the title this year. 

So overall, there are many teams that could potentially win this year’s UEFA Champions League. But, based on past performances and current standings, Barcelona, Juventus, Madrid, and Bayern Munich look to be leading contenders.
