#  The Rodeo Drive Game is the loosest 5 card draw in Vegas!

The Rodeo Drive Game at the Bellagio in Las Vegas is the loosest 5 card draw game in town. With a 3 to 2 payout on a flush and 1 to 1 on a straight, it’s no wonder that this game is popular with players.

The minimum bet for this game is $5, with a maximum of $200. The minimum raise is also $5, with a maximum of $400. Players have the option of betting either “five up” or “five down”. If you bet five up, then your next bet must be at least five times the size of your previous bet. If you bet five down, then your next bet must be at least five times the size of your current bet.

The Rodeo Drive Game can be a little confusing for first-time players, so here are some tips to help you out:

1) Always remember to bet five up or five down. This ensures that you are always betting an amount that is divisible by five.

2) When betting five up, remember that your next bet must be at least $25 (5 x $5). When betting five down, remember that your next bet must be at least $25 (5 x $5).

3) The minimum raise is always $5 (5 x $1). So if you want to raise more than $5, just multiple your desired amount by 5. For example, if you want to raise $10, then just bet $50 (10 x 5).

4) Remember that the maximum allowable raise is $400 (400 x 1). So if somebody has already raised the pot to $200, then you can only raise another $200, which would bring the total pot size to $400.

5) Pay attention to the displayed payouts. These will change depending on how many players are in the hand. As more players join the hand, the payouts get smaller. This is why it’s important to know when to fold if you don’t have a strong hand.

The Rodeo Drive Game is played at the Golden Nugget in downtown Las Vegas. There are five rounds, and each player is dealt five cards. The player with the highest card goes first. If two players have the same high card, then the player with the next highest card goes first. Play then proceeds clockwise around the table. 

In each round, players must either take one or two cards from the community pot or pull from their own cards. The player with the highest card in the round takes both cards from the pot and sets them in front of them. If more than one player has a high card, then the pot is divided between those players equally. The second-highest card takes only one card, and play continues as normal. After taking a card(s) from either the pot or their hand, players must discard one card to their hand. 

The game is over when all five rounds are complete. The player with the most points at the end of the game wins!

To calculate points, simply add up all of your face values (Aces are 1 point, 2s through 10s are face value). Face cards (King, Queen, Jack) are worth 10 points each. So if you have an Ace, two 2s, three 3s, four 4s and a 5 - your points would be 34! 

Some things to remember: 
-You can only take one or two cards in each round
-If you take two cards from either the pot or your hand, you MUST discard one card
-You cannot put any cards back into either the pot or your hand once you have taken them
