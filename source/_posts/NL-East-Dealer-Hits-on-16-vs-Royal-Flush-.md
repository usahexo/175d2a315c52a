#  NL East Dealer Hits on 16 vs Royal Flush 

In what can only be called an upset at the virtual felt, the MLB East dealer hit on a 16 against a Royal Flush. The hand took place at one of the many online poker tables hosted by the site.

The dealer, who was representing the Mets, was down to his last few chips when he was dealt two clubs and an ace. That gave him 16, which was better than the 10-high flush held by his opponent from the Royals.

"It's always exciting when there's a big pot and an upset like this one," said one of the commentators on the site's live blog. "I don't think I've ever seen anything like it."

The Royal Flush holder didn't seem too happy about it either. "That's just unlucky," he said after bowing out of the game.

For the Mets fan, it was a welcome victory. It wasn't enough to save his team from being knocked out of the tournament, but it did give him a little bit of bragging rights.

#  NL East Dealer busted for cheating at blackjack 

Recently, a blackjack dealer from the east coast was busted for cheating at the game. The dealer, who was unnamed, was caught by casino security using an unauthorized method to shuffle the cards.

It's unclear exactly how the dealer cheated, but officials believe that he or she was able to manipulate the deck in order to give themselves an advantage. This is the first known case of cheating at blackjack in this casino, and the dealer has since been fired.

This incident serves as a reminder that players should always be vigilant when playing any casino game, as there are always people looking for ways to cheat. If you suspect that someone is cheating at blackjack (or any other game), alert casino security immediately.

#  NL East Dealer caught counting cards 

In a bizarre turn of events, a dealer at an Atlantic City casino has been caught counting cards while dealing blackjack. 

The incident occurred at the Borgata Casino, where the dealer was caught by security officials after apparently being caught on camera. 

Officials say that the dealer had been using a method known as ‘card counting’ to gain an advantage over the other players at the table. 

Under normal circumstances, card counting is not illegal, but casinos are within their rights to ask players to leave if they believe that they are being advantaged in this way. 

In this case, the casino has confirmed that it has barred the dealer from its premises, and that it is currently investigating the incident.

#  NL East Dealer takes money from casino in blackjack scheme 

Blackjack is one of the most popular casino games in the world. It is a game of skill and strategy, and it can be very lucrative for those who know how to play well. There are a few basic rules of blackjack that everyone should know before playing, and there are also a few advanced techniques that can help players improve their odds of winning.

One such technique is known as card counting. Card counting is a method that allows players to keep track of the cards that have been played, in order to better predict what cards remain in the deck. This can be a very helpful tool, especially when playing against the house edge. In fact, some professional blackjack players rely almost exclusively on card counting in order to win.

There is another blackjack technique known as dealer's taking money. This technique involves taking advantage of how casinos work in order to make some extra money. Essentially, this technique involves betting heavily on blackjack when the casino is dealing from a shoe (containing several decks of cards), but switching to safer bets when the dealer is dealing from a single deck. By doing this, players can essentially take advantage of the house edge, which gives them an advantage over the casino.

While this technique may not be easy to pull off, it can be very profitable if done correctly. In fact, many professional blackjack players use dealer's taking money in order to supplement their income. So if you're looking for a way to make some extra money at the casino, this may be your best option.

#  NL East Dealer investigated for fraudulent activity at blackjack table

The New York Mets are in the middle of a scandal. Their star pitcher, Jacob deGrom, was caught cheating at blackjack in a casino.

Security footage shows deGrom counting cards at the table. When he was confronted by casino security, he claimed he was just trying to help his friend win money.

DeGrom could face criminal charges for his actions. The Mets are also likely to face penalties from the MLB. This could include a suspension or a fine.

This is not the first time that the Mets have been involved in a gambling scandal. In 2007, outfielder Carlos Beltran was caught betting on baseball games.

The Mets have had a rough few years and this latest controversy is not going to help matters. They are already facing an uphill battle to make the playoffs this season.
