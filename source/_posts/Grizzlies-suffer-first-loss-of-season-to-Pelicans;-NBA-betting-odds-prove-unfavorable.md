#  Grizzlies suffer first loss of season to Pelicans; NBA betting odds prove unfavorable

The Memphis Grizzlies suffered their first loss of the season Wednesday night, 112-106 to the New Orleans Pelicans. The Grizz were unable to cover the -4.5 point spread against the Pelicans, who have now gone 4-0 on the year.

This was an important game for the Grizzlies, as they looked to prove they are still a top team in the NBA after losing key players this offseason. However, their defense was not up to par Wednesday night and they were outrebounded 53-40 by New Orleans. A bright spot for Memphis was center Marc Gasol, who scored a game-high 29 points on 11-of-19 shooting.

The Pelicans were led offensively by guard Jrue Holiday, who had 24 points on 9-of-15 shooting. Forward Anthony Davis added 22 points and 10 rebounds for New Orleans.

NBA betting odds now favor the Golden State Warriors as the best team in the league, with Memphis falling to third behind the Cleveland Cavaliers.

#  Grizz fall to Blazers in OT; bookies take vigorous action on game

The Grizzlies were unable to come out with a victory against the Blazers when the two teams met up in overtime Monday night. The game was close throughout, with neither team leading by more than six points at any point, but the Grizzlies just couldn't seem to seal the deal. In the end, Damian Lillard hit a three-pointer as time expired in overtime to give the Blazers the 116-115 win.

The loss was a tough one for Memphis, especially since they were favored by 3.5 points according to OddsShark.com. This means that bookies took a big hit on the game, with some reporting losses of as much as $200,000 on Portland's upset win.

It will be interesting to see how this affects the Grizzlies going forward. They are currently in sixth place in the Western Conference playoff standings and are eyeing a spot in the postseason for the seventh consecutive year. However, with teams like the Jazz and Clippers starting to make a push, Memphis can't afford too many more losses if they want to keep their playoff streak alive.

#  Conley leads Memphis over Nuggets; NBA betting markets move in response

It was an old-school Memphis Grizzlies performance on Wednesday night at the Pepsi Center. The Grizzlies grinded out a 98-92 victory over the Denver Nuggets, with center Marc Gasol leading the way with 19 points, 13 rebounds and six assists. Point guard Mike Conley added 17 points and seven assists.

The win moved the Grizzlies to 11-7 on the season, and they are now firmly in playoff position in the highly competitive Western Conference. More importantly, Memphis’s victory may have swayed NBA betting markets in its favor.

According to OddsShark.com, the Grizzlies opened as 4.5-point home underdogs against the Nuggets but closed as 2-point favorites. That’s a swing of 6.5 points, which is significant given that NBA odds are often tight. It’s also worth noting that this line move occurred despite Memphis playing without shooting guard Wayne Selden Jr., who is out with a knee injury.

So what caused this line move? The answer may lie in Denver’s recent struggles. The Nuggets have lost four of their last six games, including a pair of defeats to lesser opponents in the Minnesota Timberwolves and Dallas Mavericks. In addition, superstar point guard Nikola Jokic has been slumping, averaging just 14 points and 7.8 rebounds over his last six games.

Jokic is still one of the most dangerous players in the league, but it appears that oddsmakers are starting to doubt whether he can lead Denver to a deep playoff run. The Nuggets remain one of the top teams in the West, but they no longer appear to be automatic favorites against every opponent.

This could be good news for Memphis backers ahead of their rematch with Denver on December 21st at FedEx Forum. The Grizzlies won’t be favored in that game, but they should now be considered a legitimate threat to pull off an upset victory

#  Heat top Grizzlies as injury concerns swirl; sports books adjust line accordingly

In a matchup of two teams eyeing a playoff spot in the tough Western Conference, the Miami Heat traveled to Memphis on Saturday night and came away with a 105-89 victory. The Heat, now 43-37 on the season, opened as 6.5-point favorites and covered easily, while the Grizzlies fell to 39-41 with the loss.

The game was played under unusual circumstances, as Memphis was without starting point guard Mike Conley Jr. and center Marc Gasol. The Grizzlies announced before the game that Conley would be out indefinitely due to a facial fracture, and Gasol did not play due to illness.

Memphis also played without Chandler Parsons (knee) and Brandan Wright (ankle), who are both out for the season. That lack of depth proved costly against a Heat team that was already missing Wayne Ellington (groin).

Despite being shorthanded, Memphis kept things close in the first half, trailing by just four points at halftime. However, Miami pulled away in the second half, outscoring the Grizzlies by 19 points in the final two quarters. Goran Dragic led Miami with 26 points on 10-of-15 shooting, while Hassan Whiteside added 21 points and 16 rebounds.

With the win, Miami moved into seventh place in the West standings, one game ahead of eighth-place Denver and two games ahead of ninth-place Portland. The Grizzlies remain in sixth place but are now just one game ahead of Portland.

The Heat will finish out their regular season with three road games against Philadelphia, Boston and Toronto. Memphis will close out its season with three home games against New Orleans, San Antonio and Houston.

#  Memphis loses again, this time to the Lakers; legal sports betting apps U still profitable

The Memphis Grizzlies lost to the Lakers on Wednesday night, bringing their record to 8-17 on the season. This is the latest in a long line of disappointing losses for the Grizzlies, who are now 2.5 games out of the playoffs. Memphis bettors who have relied on legal sports betting apps to place their wagers may be feeling frustrated as well.

Despite the poor performance of the Grizzlies, sports betting apps have continued to be profitable. This is largely due to the fact that NBA games have been high-scoring this season, with plenty of close matchups and upsets. Bettors who have correctly predicted these outcomes have been able to make money even when their favorite team has lost.

The Lakers are a good example of this phenomenon. They were considered underdogs heading into Wednesday night’s game against Memphis, but ended up winning by a score of 111-106. This resulted in several bettors winning big, including one who placed a $1,000 wager on Los Angeles at odds of +275.

There have been other upset winners in the NBA this season as well. The Golden State Warriors, who are currently 13-0, were beaten by the Milwaukee Bucks last month and the Dallas Mavericks recently beat the Houston Rockets. Bettors who placed bets on these teams were able to make a lot of money thanks to favorable odds and accurate predictions.

The profitability of legal sports betting apps is likely to continue throughout the rest of the NBA season. If you’re interested in trying your hand at betting on basketball games, it’s a good idea to do some research first so that you can make informed decisions about which teams to back. With so much money at stake, it’s worth taking the time to learn about how sports betting works before risking any money on it.
