#  How to Play Slot it In Pull Tab Game

Slot it In is a new pull tab game that's quickly becoming popular in casinos. If you're not familiar with the game, don't worry - we're going to teach you how to play.

The basic premise of Slot it In is to match symbols on the tabs in order to win prizes. The game consists of three reels with nine tabs each. You can bet anywhere from one to five coins on each spin, and the payout schedule varies depending on how many coins you bet.

To start, choose how many coins you want to bet on each spin by clicking on the Bet One, Bet Two, or Bet Three buttons. Once you've chosen your bet, hit the Spin Reel button to start the game. The reels will spin and stop on one of the nine tabs.

If three matching symbols appear on any of the three reels, you'll win a prize according to the payout schedule. For example, if three cherries appear, you'll win 10 coins. If three bars appear, you'll win 1000 coins.

If you want to collect your prize, hit the Collect button. If you want to risk your prize and try for a bigger payout, hit the Gamble button. This will take you to a new screen where you can guess whether a card is red or black. If you guess correctly, your prize will be doubled; if you guess incorrectly, you'll lose your entire prize.
