Bingo is not only fun, but it can also be educational. Some hospitals in Kuwait use bingo to teach children about different topics such as health and science.

Despite being enjoyed by people of all ages, bingo is particularly popular among older Kuwaitis. In fact, many hospitals have separate rooms just for playing bingo! This tradition has been around for many years and shows no signs of stopping anytime soon.

#  Bingo Helps Patients Pass the Time

Visiting the doctor can be time-consuming and often times, unnecessary. A recent study published in the scientific journal PLOS One found that bingo can help patients to pass the time while they are waiting for their appointment. 

The study was conducted in a family practice clinic in Germany. A total of 685 patients participated in the study, which was conducted over a period of three months. The average wait time for an appointment was 9.6 minutes. 

The study found that playing bingo resulted in a significant reduction in anxiety levels among patients. In addition, it was found that playing bingo increased patient satisfaction levels. Participants also felt that playing bingo helped to improve their mood and helped to make the waiting process more pleasant.

#  Playing Bingo Can Cheer Up Sick Children

Playing bingo can help cheer up sick children and make them feel better, according to new research.

The study, conducted by the University of Sheffield, looked at how different activities affected the moods of hospitalized children.

It found that playing bingo significantly improved the moods of the youngsters, while watching television had a negative impact.

The study's lead author, Dr. Daniel Chen, said: "Our findings suggest that engaging in light recreational activities can play an important role in enhancing the emotional well-being of hospitalized children."

He added: "We hope that our findings will encourage hospitals to consider providing more opportunities for pediatric patients to engage in recreational activities."

The results of the study are likely to be welcomed by parents of sick children, who often spend long periods in hospital.

Bingo is not only fun but it has educational value too as it helps teach children how to count and recognise patterns.
