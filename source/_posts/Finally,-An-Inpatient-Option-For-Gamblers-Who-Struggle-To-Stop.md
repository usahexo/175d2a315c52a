#  Finally, An Inpatient Option For Gamblers Who Struggle To Stop

Gambling is a contentious issue. Some people see it as a harmless diversion, while others see it as a deadly addiction. What's not in dispute is the damage that gambling can do to people and families. There are few inpatient options for people with gambling problems, but that may be changing.

The University of Alberta is opening a new program specifically for people with gambling problems. The program will offer 12 weeks of inpatient treatment followed by 12 weeks of outpatient treatment. It's hoped that this program will help people who have been unable to stop gambling on their own.

There are currently only two other inpatient programs for gambling addicts in Canada, and both are in Toronto. The University of Alberta program will be the first one west of Toronto. There are no such programs in the United States.

Many experts believe that more inpatient options are needed for people with gambling problems. Gambling addiction can be very difficult to overcome, and many people need more than outpatient treatment to succeed. Inpatient treatment can provide a safe environment where people can focus on their recovery without the distractions of everyday life.

For some people, outpatient treatment isn't enough because they can't resist the temptation to gamble. This new program at the University of Alberta offers them a chance to get the help they need in a controlled environment. It's hoped that this program will help more people overcome their addiction to gambling and return to healthy lives.

#  Time-Tested Programs Help Patients Quit Gambling For Good

People who are addicted to gambling have a tough road ahead of them, but fortunately, there are programs that have been time-tested and shown to help patients quit gambling for good.

One such program is the Gambler’s Anonymous 12-step program. This program is based on the 12 steps of Alcoholics Anonymous, which have been shown to be effective in helping people overcome addiction. The 12 steps of Gambler’s Anonymous are as follows:

1. We admitted we were powerless over gambling - that our lives had become unmanageable.
2. Came to believe that a Power greater than ourselves could restore us to sanity.
3. Made a decision to turn our will and our lives over to the care of God as we understood Him. 
4. Made a searching and fearless moral inventory of ourselves. 
5. Admitted to God, to ourselves, and to another human being the exact nature of our wrongs. 
6. Were entirely ready to have God remove all these defects of character.
7. Humbly asked Him to remove our shortcomings. 
8. Made a list of all persons we had harmed, and became willing to make amends to them all. 
9. Made direct amends to such people wherever possible, except when to do so would injure them or others still living. 
10. Continued to take personal inventory and when we were wrong promptly admitted it."

#  What To Expect When Entering Inpatient Gambling Treatment

For those who are struggling with a gambling addiction, inpatient gambling treatment may be the best solution. This type of treatment can provide you with the support and resources you need to overcome your addiction. However, it is important to be aware of what to expect before entering inpatient treatment.

Inpatient gambling treatment typically lasts for 28 days or more. During this time, you will live at the treatment facility and participate in a variety of therapeutic activities. These activities may include individual counseling, group therapy, educational lectures, and recreational activities.

The goal of inpatient gambling treatment is to help you learn how to manage your addiction and live a healthy life free from gambling. You will likely be assigned a case manager who will work with you on a one-on-one basis to create a personalized treatment plan.

*Ability to receive 24/7 care and supervision
*Daily access to mental health professionals
*Opportunity to build a support network of peers who are also struggling with gambling addiction

However, inpatient treatment also has some drawbacks, including:

*Costs can be prohibitive for some people
*Requires significant time commitment
*May not be appropriate for all types of addictions

#  What Happens In Inpatient Gambling Treatment?

Inpatient gambling treatment can be a lifesaver for those addicted to gambling. It can provide a place for gamblers to get away from their environment and the temptation to gamble, and it can provide access to therapy, education, and support groups.

What happens during inpatient gambling treatment? Generally, those in treatment will attend group therapy sessions and educational lectures on addiction. They may also attend 12-step meetings or other support groups. In some cases, they will also have individual therapy with a therapist specializing in addiction.
