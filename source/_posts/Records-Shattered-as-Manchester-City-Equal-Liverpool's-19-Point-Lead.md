#  Records Shattered as Manchester City Equal Liverpool's 19-Point Lead

Manchester City have now equalled Liverpool's 19-point lead at the top of the Premier League, as they recorded a 3-1 victory over Southampton on Wednesday night.

This latest win means that Pep Guardiola's side have now won 18 of their opening 19 league games - a club record. The only blemish on their record this season is a 0-0 draw away to Liverpool in October.

It was an eventful game at St Mary's Stadium, with both sides having chances to take the lead in the first half. However, it was Manchester City who made the breakthrough in the second half, as Raheem Sterling scored twice in the space of two minutes.

Sterling then added a third goal for Manchester City in the 77th minute, before Mohamed Elyounoussi pulled one back for Southampton in injury time.

With this latest victory, Manchester City move 11 points clear of second-placed Tottenham Hotspur, and they now look unstoppable in their quest to win their first Premier League title since 2013-14.

#  Manchester United Sneak Into 4th Place After Victory Over Tottenham

Manchester United’s 2-1 victory over Tottenham Hotspur on the last day of the Premier League season has seen them snatch fourth place and Champions League qualification from neighbours Manchester City.

The match itself was a thrilling affair, with both sides creating plenty of chances, but goals from Alexis Sanchez and Ander Herrera were enough to seal the win for United – and condemn Spurs to another season in the Europa League.

It was an especially sweet victory for United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, who got one over on his former club and also ensured that his record of never having finished outside of the top four as a manager remains intact.

It was a heart-breaking end to the season for Spurs, who had battled hard for a top four spot all year long, but will now have to make do with playing in Europe’s second tier competition.

United’s win means that they will take on Barcelona in the Champions League quarter-finals, while Tottenham will face off against Ajax.

#  Arsenal Lose to Southampton, Drop to 7th in the Table

Arsenal lost to Southampton on Wednesday, with a final score of 2-1. This dropped them down to 7th in the Premier League table, giving up their chance at a top-four finish and UEFA Champions League qualification.

The Gunners actually got off to a good start in the match, taking the lead in the 5th minute through an Olivier Giroud goal. However, they couldn't hold onto that lead for long, as Southampton equalized just 10 minutes later. The game would stay tied until the 84th minute, when Dusan Tadic scored what would be the game-winning goal for the Saints.

This loss is a big disappointment for Arsenal, as they had been in control of their own destiny heading into this match. With only two games remaining in the season, they'll now need some help from other teams if they want to make it back into Europe's top club competition.

Their next match is against Stoke City on Sunday, and they'll need to win that game if they want any chance of making it back into the top four.

#  Chelsea and Liverpool Drawn in FA Cup Semi Final

On Sunday Chelsea and Liverpool were both drawn in the semi final of the FA Cup. This will be the first time these two teams have faced off in a competitive match in over five years.

Liverpool come into this match as the favourites, as they are currently sitting in second place in the Premier League, while Chelsea are in fifth. However, Chelsea have been on good form lately, winning their last three matches.

The first match between these two teams will be played at Anfield on 14th April. The return leg will be played at Stamford Bridge on 21st April.

#  Manchester City Win Premier League by Breaking Multiple Records

Manchester City became the champions of the Premier League for the third time in seven seasons, with a record-breaking performance.

The title was City’s fifth top-flight championship and their first in the Premier League era. They also became the first team in English top-flight history to reach 100 points, setting a new points record in the process.

Manager Pep Guardiola guided his side to this incredible feat, having also broken Chelsea’s record for most wins in a season (30) and most consecutive Premier League wins (18). The Spaniard has now won league titles in six out of the last seven seasons as a manager.

Guardiola has reinvigorated Manchester City since his arrival at the club in 2016, with the brand of football on display at the Etihad Stadium being some of the most aesthetically pleasing in world football. This season, they have scored 106 goals in all competitions – more than any other team in Europe’s top five leagues.

The likes of Kevin De Bruyne, David Silva and Sergio Aguero have been instrumental in City’s success this season, with all three players scoring over 10 goals each. They will be looking to make an impact on the European stage next season, after crashing out at the quarter-final stage this year to Liverpool.

Liverpool themselves had an excellent season, finishing runners-up in the Premier League and reaching their first Champions League final for 11 years. However, they were ultimately outclassed by Manchester City over two legs and will be disappointed not to have lifted their sixth European Cup title.
