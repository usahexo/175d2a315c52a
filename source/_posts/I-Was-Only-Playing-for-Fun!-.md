#  I Was Only Playing for Fun! 

I was recently in an online discussion about the ethics of competitive gaming. I play a lot of games competitively, and so does my friend who was arguing with me. We were discussing how people can get really into it and how it's not really fair to everyone else if someone is playing to win. 

It's a valid point, but I don't think we're approaching the issue from the right angle. People play games for many reasons: to have fun, to learn, to compete, and so on. There isn't a single reason why anyone does anything. In fact, people can vary their motivations from day to day or even within the same game. 

I play games to have fun. If I'm not having fun, I'll stop playing. But that doesn't mean I'm going to stop trying hard or stop taking the game seriously. I want to win because winning feels good, but I'm still playing for fun. It's just that my definition of "fun" includes winning sometimes. 

My friend was arguing that if someone is playing to win, they're not really playing for fun anymore and are being unfair to everyone else who is also playing for fun. But this logic doesn't make sense because it presumes that there is only one way to enjoy a game and that anyone who doesn't enjoy it the same way is being cheated. 

This attitude closes people off from new experiences and prevents them from enjoying games in different ways. It's like saying that you can only eat hamburgers at McDonalds and that anyone who wants something else is being unfair to you. Yes, it's possible to only enjoy hamburgers at McDonalds, but there are many other places where you can get them too! And there are also many other types of food for you to try! 

The same thing applies to games. There are many different ways to enjoy them, and just because someone enjoys winning more than you do doesn't mean they're not playing for fun too.

When we do something wrong, it's natural to want to apologize. But what should you do after you've apologized? Luckily, there are a few things you can do to help make things right again.

1. Repair the Damage

If you've done something that has caused physical damage, try to repair it as best as you can. This might mean fixing a broken bone, cleaning up a mess, or mending a torn shirt. If you can't fix the damage yourself, ask someone else to help.

2. Make Amends

If your actions have caused someone harm or hardship, try to make amends for what you did. This might mean returning what was stolen, making financial restitution, or doing work for the person you harmed.

3. Show Remorse

Make sure that the person knows that you are truly sorry for your actions. Use words and body language that show that you regret what you did and that you want to make things right. Don't just say "sorry"--show why you're sorry.

4. Follow Through

After apologizing, follow through with your promises. If you said you would pay back money, do it. If you said you would help with cleanup, do it. Don't make any more promises until you've actually followed through with the ones you've already made.

5. Don't Pretend It Didn't Happen

It's important not to act like the apology never happened--that will only make things worse. Accept responsibility for your actions and move on. Try not to repeat the same mistake in the future.
