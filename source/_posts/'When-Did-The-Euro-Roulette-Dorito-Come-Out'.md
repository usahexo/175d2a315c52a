#  'When Did The Euro Roulette Dorito Come Out?'


This is a question that has been on the tongues of many Doritos fans for years. The answer to this question is not easy to find, as it seems that the release of this flavor is shrouded in mystery. However, through careful detective work and internet sleuthing, we have been able to piece together what may be the answer.

The Euro Roulette flavor is said to have first hit store shelves in Europe in the early 2000s. This would make sense, as it was around this time that Doritos began to really take off in popularity overseas. However, it does not appear that the flavor made its way to North America until much later. A few online commenters have mentioned purchasing Euro Roulette Doritos as far back as 2007, but there is no solid evidence to back this up.

It wasn't until late 2014 that chatter about the Euro Roulette flavor began to really pick up online. This was likely due to two factors - Pepsi's acquisition of Frito-Lay in 2013, and the increasing popularity of food bloggers and review websites. Suddenly, people were interested in trying this elusive flavor, and they were turning to the internet for information on where they could find it.

As it turns out, the Euro Roulette flavor was not readily available in stores across North America. In fact, you could only find it if you happened to live close to a specialty import store or knew someone who could bring some back for you from overseas. This made it all the more coveted by snack lovers - and resulted in resellers charging a high price for bags of the chips online.

In January of 2015, PepsiCo announced that they were discontinuing the Euro Roulette flavor due to low demand. This sent shockwaves throughout the Doritos fandom, as people scrambled to hoard what few bags of chips they could find. And so ends the story of the elusive Euro Roulette Dorito... or does it?

Earlier this year, a Wal-Mart employee took to Reddit claiming that his store had received a shipment of Euro Roulette Doritos just a few weeks ago. Could this be true? Or was it just another false alarm among all of the other rumours that have circulated over the years? Only time will tell...

#  'Finally, A Roulette Dorito Worth Buying!'

One of my all-time favorite snacks is the glorious Roulette Dorito. But for years, I've grown increasingly frustrated with the lack of a truly great Roulette Dorito on the market. The first few times I tried them, I thought maybe I was crazy. They just didn't taste as good as the ones I grew up with.

But then, a few weeks ago, I tried a Roulette Dorito at a friend's house and—WOW!—I finally found one that was worth buying. It had the perfect mix of spices and flavor that made it just as good (if not better) than the ones I remembered from childhood.

After doing a bit of research, I discovered that this particular Roulette Dorito comes from Ruffles' Premiere line of chips. And luckily for us, they seem to be pretty widely available at most stores. So if you're looking for a great new snack to try, be sure to pick up a bag (or two) of these delicious Roulette Doritos!

#  'Is The Euro Roulette Dorito Really That Good?'

Introduced in the 1970s, the Dorito is a triangular-shaped corn chip that is popular in the United States and Mexico. The Dorito's popularity has grown so much over the years that there are now spin-off versions of the chip, such as the Cheetos and Fritos. One such spin-off is the Euro Roulette Dorito.

The Euro Roulette Dorito is a bit different from the original in that it is made with a red roulette cheese flavor. Some people love it, while others find it a bit too cheesy. So, is this version of the Dorito really that good?

 opinions seem to be split on this one. Some people say that the cheese flavor overwhelms everything else and that it's not as good as the original Dorito. Others say that they love the cheese flavor and find it to be just as good - if not better - than the original.

At the end of the day, it's up to individual taste preferences. If you're adventurous and like something with a stronger cheese flavor, then go ahead and give the Euro Roulette Dorito a try!
