#  Mauritius to Invest in Blackjack 

The Republic of Mauritius is set to invest in blackjack, with the hope of turning the island into a premier gambling destination. The government has already made moves to open up the market to foreign investors, and officials say that they are very confident that the investment will pay off.

Mauritius has long been known for its high-quality casinos, but blackjack has never been a major focus. That is all set to change, as the government looks to capitalize on the growing popularity of the game.

Officials believe that there is plenty of potential in the market, and they are eager to get started. Blackjack is a game that can be enjoyed by players of all skill levels, so there is sure to be something for everyone.

The government has also pledged to invest in infrastructure upgrades, in order to make sure that the island is ready for tourism growth. This includes everything from new roads to improved airport facilities.

It is clear that Mauritius is serious about becoming a gambling destination, and blackjack is just the beginning. There are plenty of other games waiting to be explored, and it will be interesting to see how things progress in the years ahead.

#  Double Down for Better Odds in Blackjack 

If you are like most casino players, when it comes to blackjack you want to make the best decisions possible in order to increase your chances of winning. One way to do this is by doubling down – which is when you place an additional bet equal to your initial bet, and receive just one more card.

When it comes to doubling down, there are a few things you need to keep in mind. First of all, the dealer must have at least a ten-point hand before you can double down. So if the dealer’s upcard is a two and they draw a six, they would have an 18 (since 2 + 6 = 8). In this case, you would not be able to double down because the dealer’s total does not exceed 21. 

You also want to make sure that the amount you are betting is worth it. For example, if you have a $10 chip and the minimum bet at the table is $20, it might not be worth it to double down – especially if the dealer has a good hand. In this case, it might be wiser to simply stand or hit.

When it comes to doubling down, there are a few things you should remember: 
-The dealer must have at least a ten-point hand before you can double down 
-Make sure the amount you are betting is worth it 
-Remember that when you double down, you are risking twice as much as your initial bet

#  Mauritius Seeks Gambling License For Blackjack 

The Mauritius government is seeking a gambling license for the game of blackjack from the United Kingdom Gambling Commission. The island nation is hoping to attract overseas casinos to set up operation on the island.

Mauritius has been attempting to bolster its tourism industry in recent years, and gambling is seen as a potential boon to that effort. The country already licenses a number of other popular casino games, including roulette and baccarat.

blackjack is seen as particularly attractive because of its relatively low house edge. Casinos can make a healthy profit while still giving players a fair chance at winning.

Mauritius is located in the Indian Ocean, off the southeast coast of Africa. The country has a population of just over 1 million people and is known for its luxury resorts and stunning beaches.

#  Tourism Ministry eyes Blackjack for Mauritius 

The Ministry of Tourism is eyeing Blackjack as a potential new attraction for Mauritius.

Tourism Minister Michael Sik Yuen said the ministry was in discussions with casino operators about bringing the game to the island.

“We are looking at Blackjack because it is a very popular game,” Sik Yuen said.

He added that talks were at an early stage and no final decision had been made.

Mauritius has long been a popular destination for holidaymakers, with its beaches, luxury resorts and casinos.

In recent years, however, the island has also become increasingly popular with gamers thanks to its growing number of online casinos.

Blackjack is a card game that typically involves players betting against the house. The object of the game is to score 21 points without going bust.

#  Mauritius Plays Catch Up In The Global Gaming Race

Mauritius is among the countries which have recently legalized and regulated the gaming industry. This is seen as an opportunity by many to cash in on this fast-growing industry, with projections of it reaching a value of $32 billion by 2021.

The global gaming market is currently estimated at $100 billion, and it is expected to grow at a CAGR of 10.5% in the next five years. A large part of this growth will be driven by the Asia Pacific region, which is expected to account for around 42% of the total market share by 2021.

Apart from Mauritius, countries such as Japan, South Korea, and Thailand are also in the process of legalizing and regulating the gaming industry. This is in line with their efforts to boost economic growth and attract more tourists.

In Thailand, for instance, casino licenses are being issued for two new resorts in Pattaya and Phuket. These are seen as important projects that will help make Thailand a top global gaming destination. The country has also set a target to welcome 20 million tourists by 2020, up from the current 16 million.

South Korea is another country that is looking to tap into the lucrative gaming market. The government there has been working on a bill that would legalize casino gambling and make it available only to foreigners. If passed, this bill would mark a major shift in the country’s stance on gambling, which has been traditionally frowned upon.

Japan is another major player in the race to legalize gaming. The government there has plans to issue licenses for three new casino resorts by 2020. These resorts will be located in Tokyo, Osaka, and Yokohama, and are expected to bring in billions of dollars in revenue each year.

While some countries are just beginning their journey into the world of legalized gaming, others are further down the road. Macau, for instance, is currently the largest gambling hub in the world with revenues of over $30 billion per year. This number is expected to grow even further as more countries legalize gaming within their borders.

The legalization and regulation of the gaming industry offers many opportunities for countries looking to boost economic growth and tourism numbers. It remains to be seen which country will come out on top in this global race
