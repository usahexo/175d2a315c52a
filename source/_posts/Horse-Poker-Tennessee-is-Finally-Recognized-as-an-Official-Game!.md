#  How to Play Horse Poker Tennessee

There are variations of poker that are played in different parts of the country. Horse Poker Tennessee is one game that has regional appeal. The following article will provide all the information necessary for players in Tennessee and beyond to enjoy this game.

Horse Poker Tennessee is a game that is typically played with five players. The object of the game is to form the best five-card hand using any combination of the seven cards available to each player. The game begins with an ante, which is a small bet placed by each player at the beginning of the hand. After the ante has been placed, three cards are dealt face down to each player. These are known as hole cards or pocket cards. The dealer then places three cards face up on the table, which are known as community cards.

The player with the highest ranking card in their hole cards starts the betting round. This player is called the horse or cowboy. If two or more players have the same high ranking card, then the player with the second highest ranking card starts the betting round. The betting continues clockwise around the table until all players have either folded or placed a bet equal to twice the size of the ante.

After all bets have been placed, one more card is turned over, which is known as the turn card. This card completes the first four cards of each player’s hand. The player with the best possible five-card hand using only these four cards wins the pot (the sum of all bets placed in that particular hand). If two or more players have identical hands, then they split the pot equally between them. If there is no winner because all players folded pre-flop, then the pot remains on offer for next hand.
