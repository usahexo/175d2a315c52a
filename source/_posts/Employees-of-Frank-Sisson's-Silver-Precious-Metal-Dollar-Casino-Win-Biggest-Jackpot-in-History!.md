#  Employees of Frank Sisson's Silver Precious Metal Dollar Casino Win Biggest Jackpot in History!

����������������
Las Vegas, NV - The employees of Frank Sisson's Silver Precious Metal Dollar Casino hit the jackpot earlier this week when a group of them won the largest jackpot in history! The group, made up of managers, clerks and security personnel, won a total of $153 million dollars playing the casino's new "Golden Wheel" game.

����������������
"We're all just so excited!" said one of the winners, who asked to remain anonymous. "We can't believe it actually happened to us."

The Golden Wheel game is a new addition to the casino and is similar to the popular slot machines found in most casinos. However, instead of spinning reels, players spin a large wheel with different values displayed on it. The winner is the person who spins the wheel to land on the highest value.

Frank Sisson, owner of the casino, was quoted as saying "I'm just thrilled for my staff! They've worked hard for this and they deserve it." Sisson went on to say that he plans to upgrade the casino with some new additions in honor of his employees' big win.

#  Former Employees of Frank Sisson's Casino Share their Stories

Frank Sisson was a man who many looked up to in the city of Las Vegas. He was a successful businessman and casino mogul. He was a generous philanthropist and a loving husband and father. But what most people didn't know was that Frank had a dark side.

For years, Frank had been abusing his employees, demanding outrageous work hours and punishing them with verbal abuse and even physical violence if they didn't meet his high standards. Many of his former employees have chosen to stay silent about their experiences out of fear of retribution from Frank or his powerful friends, but recently they have started to come forward with their stories.

One employee, who wishes to remain anonymous, recounts her experience working for Frank: "He would scream at us constantly, calling us stupid and incompetent. If we made any mistake, he would hit us or throw things at us. I was so scared of him that I even quit my other job so I could work for him full-time."

Another employee, also wishing to remain anonymous, spoke about the time that Frank punched him in the face: "I had been working for him for about six months when one day he just lost it. He came up behind me and punched me in the face, causing me to fall to the ground. Then he just walked away like it was nothing."

Many employees describe being constantly exhausted from working long hours without breaks or overtime pay. One employee recalls having to work 72 hours straight: "I was absolutely exhausted by the time I finally got home. I barely had time to eat or sleep, let alone see my family."

Frank's abusive behavior towards his employees finally caught up with him in 2015 when one of his security guards filed a lawsuit against him alleging years of abuse and harassment. The lawsuit received national media attention and spurred other employees to come forward with their own stories of abuse. In the end, Frank settled the lawsuit out of court for an undisclosed amount of money.

Since then, Frank has retired from his casino business and moved to a remote island off the coast of Maine. He seldom speaks to anyone outside of his close circle of family and friends, and no one knows what he is doing there or how he is living day-to-day. But despite all that has happened, many people still look up to Frank Sisson as a successful business man and community leader. Only time will tell if his dark secrets will eventually catch up with him again.
